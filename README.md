<a id="Details"></a>
## Project details
* This project started by forking [PTDreamer's firmware](https://github.com/PTDreamer/stm32_soldering_iron_controller). Since then it became a separate project.
* Developed on STM32Cube IDE. Basic configuration is easily done in CubeMx (Included in STM32Cube IDE).
* Unified codebase, different hardware support based on profiles, very few files need to be changed.
* Supports all display modes: I2C, SPI, software and hardware+DMA (When connected to hardware pins).
* Uses u8g2 graphics library. 
* Dynamic screen loading to save RAM resources.
* Extremely customizable, lots of options available.
* Code highly optimized to avoid wasting cpu power, slow devices still run great.    
* Check [Releases](https://github.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/releases) for downloads.<br>

## Compatibility

The actual requirements are 10KB RAM and 64KB **(\*)** flash.<br>
**(\*)** Currently the firmware has surpassed the 64KB limit, and uses the additional undocumented 64KB flash block.<br>
**(\*)** All 64KB devices have 128KB, with the 2nd 64KB block untested from the factory, so not guaranteed to work.<br>
**(\*)** To date, I have found zero issues. Original KSGER firmware also does this.<br>
**(\*)** ST-Link checks the written data, and the firmware uses checksums to protect the settings, any error will be detected.<br>

Some controllers are using stm32 clones, sometimes relabeled as genuine STM32, causing problems.<br>
Check [STM32 Clones](Readme_files/Programming.md#clone-detection) section to find out how to detect a genuine STM32.<br>
- The only known working clone is CKS32.<br>
- GD32, MM32 and CH32 have issues with the ADC converter.<br>
- APM32 hasn't been tested yet.<br>

If your board came with a clone, you can replace it with a STM32F101/102/103, they're pin-compatible.<br>

The [BOARDS](https://github.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/tree/master/BOARDS) folder has the board profiles and some schematics / pictures for quickly identify your hardware.<br>
Check [Dreamcat4 T12 controllers](https://github.com/dreamcat4/t12-t245-controllers-docs), did a much better collection with T12 boards schematics and pictures.<br><br>
Currently supported controllers:<br>
* **Quicko T12-072** : First gen Quicko, STM32F072 variant. Current firmware is broken, use [this one](https://github.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/raw/9f4b7f9565344e30a6ce1394d28350f82089488b/BOARDS/Quicko/STM32F072_SSD1306/STM32SolderingStation.bin).<br>
* **Quicko T12-103** First gen Quicko, STM32F103 variant.
* **KSGER v1.5** : Profile for STM32F103 (There are no other known CPUs used in this board).
* **KSGER v2**,   **JCD T12**, **T12-955**, **Handskit** : Profile compatible with all STM32F101/2/3xx models.
* **KSGER v3**,   **T12-958** : Profile compatible with all STM32F101/2/3xx models.

Don't follow the version reported in the original firmware to identify your board.<br>
The easiest way to quickly identify your controller version is by looking at the Oled screen connection:<br>
- **4 pin** (I2C) = Generic v2 (KSGER/Quecoo/Handskit/etc)<br>
- **6 pin** (SPI) = Generic v3<br>
- **7 pin** (SPI) = Only used by KSGER v1.5 or 1st gen Quicko, easy to differentiate.<br><br>

For KSGER v2/v3: As long as use the correct firmware, any STM32 variant (101/102/103/C8/R8/CB/RB) will work.<br>
There are several compatible/cloned boards in the market that will work fine with Ksger profiles.<br>

T12-951, T12-952, T12-956, T12-959 use STC mcu, not supported by this firmware.<br>

## Frequently asked questions<br>

First, make sure to read the [Operating instructions](Readme_files/Operation.md)!<br>
 
### Changelog<br>
You can check the [commit history](https://github.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/commits/master) to see what have been changed between builds.

### Backing up the original firmware
The original firmwares are available [[HERE]](https://github.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/tree/master/Original_FW)<br>
Some KSGER firmwares require an activation code which can be generated [[HERE]](http://t12.omegahg.com/keygen.htm)  [[Alternative link]](https://rawcdn.githack.com/deividAlfa/stm32_soldering_iron_controller/3f48a9c4c9586f89503ce763b1c6a73b9b73b55a/Original_FW/KSGER/Gen/gen.htm)<br>

Be warned, usually the MCU will be read-protected, so you won't be able to read its contents, only erase it.<br> 
The simplest way to not loose the original FW is actually to buy a new MCU, replace it, and store the original MCU in a safe place.<br>
Any difference in the pinout will require firmware tuning, although one of the main proposits of this firmware is easing that.<br>
There are some hacks / vulnerabilities that can be used to backup protected firmware, more details here:<br>
**[STM32 power glitching timing attack](https://github.com/dreamcat4/t12-t245-controllers-docs/tree/master/tools/software/STM32CubeIDE#option-2-power-glitching-timing-attack
)**<br>

### Display issues<br>
If the display has right/left line like this picture: Go to [System menu](Readme_files/Operation.md#system) / Offset and adjust the value until it's centered.<br>
<img src="/Readme_files/oled_offset.jpg?raw=true" width="320"><br>

### Temperature unstability<br>
By default, never modify any PWM / Delay settings in the [Iron menu](Readme_files/Operation.md#menu). Doing so may cause such issues.<br>
Also, new tips are often unstable, leading to temperature jumps.<br>
Don't try to calibrate the tip in this state, neither set a high temperature, because it could go under control.<br>
They usually settle after some burning time. It's recommended to set a medium temperature (250-300ÂºC) and leave like that for 15-20 minutes until it stabilizes.<br>
If the temps are still unstable, try increasing the Iron/Delay option, allowing more time for the temp signal to settle.<br>
A damaged, loose or defective connection in the handle will also cause this issues. Ensure the contacts are clean.<br>
There have been problems with some board/stations like:<br>
* Noisy power supply
* Broken / badly soldered capacitors
* Bad Op-Amp
* Bad 3v3 Regulator

If you're getting "NTC high/low" error even when disabling the NTC in settings, then your STM32 is fake.<br>
Check Clones in [Compatibility](#Compatibility) section.<br>

### Temperature accuracy
Buying a cheap high temperature meter is highly recommended!<br>
These boards can have pretty different readings and tolerances. Even between T12 tips.<br>
So the factory calibration is intentionally set lower than real, to avoid possible overheating problems.<br>
Once you set the firmware, go to calibration and set there the real temperature measured with the external probe.<br>

### Calibration issues<br>
Ensure to read [Calibration menu](Readme_files/Operation.md#calibration) first!.<br>
To calibrate, go into Calibration / Start.<br>
Attach the temperature probe before proceeding!<br>
If the difference between measured and real is higher than 50ÂºC, the calibration will be aborted, telling you to go into Calibration / Settings and manually adjust the values.<br>
The calibration settings menu has 3 calibration steps: Zero set, 250 and 400Â°C.<br>
When you edit 250/400ÂºC value, the power will be enabled and the value applied in real time, so be careful!<br>
The power will be removed when no settings are being edited.<br>
Adjust each value until it's close to the target temperature. Repeat for each step and save.<br>
This values are only used by the calibration process, to prevent burning the tip if your board reads too low.<br>
After adjusting, repeat calibration, this time it should work correctly.<br>
The calibration results for the current tip can be seen in the tip settings menu.<br>
Tip settings menu calibration values aren't meant to be another calibration menu, only for viewing (Ex. reporting calibration results) and for backup/restore purposes.<br>
In the case you lose, wipe or reset the data, you can go back into that menu and adjust the values based on previous calibration results.<br>
Zero calibration can't be manually restored, but it only takes few seconds to adjust.<br>

### Cold tip not showing ambient temperature
Some amplifiers can introduce a small voltage offset that will translate into the cold tip reading 30-50Â°C higher than ambient temperature.<br>
To fix that, enter the [Calibration menu](Readme_files/Operation.md#calibration), insert a completely cold tip, enter Settings, adjust Zero set calibration and save.<br>
After that, the offset will be compensated and the cold temperature will be normal.<br>
It's highly recommended to recalibrate after changing this value.<br>

### KSGER self-resetting<br>
Some KSGER controllers use a linear regulator to convert 24V to 3.3V, which is a very bad design and generates a lot of heat.<br>
With the oled displays, each pixel turned on consumes more power, and this firmware uses a larger font for displaying the temperature.<br>
Thus, this firmware uses some more power. The design is so bad that the regulator will overload and shut down, resetting the board.<br>
There're some options to fix this:<br>
- Lower the display brightness to reduce the power consumption.<br>
- Put a 100-150Î© 2W resistor in series with the regulator (24V->Resistor->LDO input). The resistor will drop part of the voltage and reduce the stress on the regulator.<br>
- Replace the LDO with a better one or modify the board, adding a small heatsink to take away the heat.<br>
- Use a small DC/DC step-down module to convert 24V to 5V, and feed 5V to the 3.3V LDO (best option, barely makes any heat).<br>

### Non working features
* I2C eeprom. Some boards have it, some doesn't. So internal flash storage is used for all.<br>
Also, the current settings don't fit in the commonly used 24C08 memory.<br>
* RTC clock. There's very little space in the screen. Use it for what matters, instead for showing a clock!
